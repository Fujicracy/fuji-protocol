## Coding Style and Conventions

# Solidity

We use [solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/blob/master/docs/rules.md) as a linter and [prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) as a code formatter.

A non-exhausitve list with some coding rules to be applied:

- Contract names must be CamelCase, so the file containg it.
- Public and external functions name must be in camelCase.
- Private and internal functions name must be in _camelCase.
- Getter functions must be in getCamelCase.
- Setter functions must be in setCamelCase.
- Function parameters must be in _camelCase.
- Event names must be in CamelCase.
- Modifier name must be in mixedCase.
- Private and internal variables must be in _camelCase.
- Public variables must be in camelCase.
