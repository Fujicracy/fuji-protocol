    // Generalities about the Vault:
    //
    // - Whenever documentation refers to 'tokens', it strictly refers to ERC20-compliant token contracts. Tokens are
    // transferred out of the Vault by calling the `IERC20.transfer` function, and transferred in by calling
    // `IERC20.transferFrom`. In these cases, the sender must have previously allowed the Vault to use their tokens by
    // calling `IERC20.approve`. The only deviation from the ERC20 standard that is supported is functions not returning
    // a boolean value: in these scenarios, a non-reverting call is assumed to be successful.
    //
    // - All non-view functions in the Vault are non-reentrant: calling them while another one is mid-execution (e.g.
    // while execution control is transferred to a token contract during a swap) will result in a revert. View
    // functions can be called in a re-reentrant way, but doing so might cause them to return inconsistent results.
    // Contracts calling view functions in the Vault must make sure the Vault has not already been entered.
    //
    // - View functions revert if referring to either unregistered Pools, or unregistered tokens for registered Pools.

    // Flash Loans

    /**
     * @dev Performs a 'flash loan', sending tokens to `recipient`, executing the `receiveFlashLoan` hook on it,
     * and then reverting unless the tokens plus a proportional protocol fee have been returned.
     *
     * The `tokens` and `amounts` arrays must have the same length, and each entry in these indicates the loan amount
     * for each token contract. `tokens` must be sorted in ascending order.
     *
     * The 'userData' field is ignored by the Vault, and forwarded as-is to `recipient` as part of the
     * `receiveFlashLoan` call.
     *
     * Emits `FlashLoan` events.
